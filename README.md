# Lecture-Joiner
Simmple pyautogui code to join zoom calls. In a very latent stage.

Just a simple program/macro I made to join lectures in the morning by running just one program.

Will try to push more revisions  to increase functionality and scalability

Libraries required-
pyautogui, subprocess, time
